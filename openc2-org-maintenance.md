# Maintaining the OpenC2.org Website

This note captures the SOP for approving changes to the
[openc2.org](https://www.openc2.org) website, which exists to
support awareness & adoption of OpenC2. 

## Website Information

The OpenC2.org website is hosted using GitHub pages, and is
composed of a mixture of markdown and HTML content.  Instructions
for maintaining the website are included in the source
repository's [README.md
file](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-org.github.io/blob/main/README.md).


## Maintenance SOP

 - Privileges to commit changes to the OpenC2.org website (AKA,
   the "write team") are assigned to:
   - the TC Co-Chairs
   - the TC Secretary
   - the website architect [^1]
 - The TC Secretary serves as the Website Editor.
 - Website changes are proposed using GitHub pull requests
   directed to the
   [openc2-org.githib.io](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-org.github.io)
   repository. Any TC member can propose website changes.
 - The Website Editor can directly commit **routine / editorial
   changes** (typos, wrong dates, broken links) without further
   approval.
 - **Moderate** changes should be reviewed and approved by a
   second write team member before merging:
   - New [“OpenC2 in the News”](https://openc2.org/news.html)
     items (*exception:* information regarding publication of new
     or updated documents by OASIS can be posted without
     secondary review)
   - New / updated / replacement home page carousel items
   - Items of comparable impact to the above
 - A [Working Meeting](Working-Meeting-Process.md) should
   approve:
   - Any **substantive changes** to content
   - Any **structural changes** to the site
 - Either TC Co-Chair or the Secretary can approve an “urgent”
   change that would normally go through the working meeting, if
   needed (shouldn't really have any of those).

## History

This SOP was originally agreed to by the Implementation
Considerations Subcommittee in October 2020. With the abolition
of the subcommittees in March 2021, the responsbility for
approving significant website changes was transferred to the
[Working Meeting](Working-Meeting-Process.md) process, and the
text above reflects that change.

provided by AT&T. The architect is not involved in routine
maintenance of the website.
