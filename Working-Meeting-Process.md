# Working Meeting Process
#### Information for TC members about planning and conducting working meetings.

As explained in the [General Member
Information](General-Member-Info.md) document, the TC conducts
three working meetings on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Wednesdays of
each month at 11:00 am Eastern time. This document describes the
norms for planning, conducting, and recording the results of
working meetings. Working meetings primarily focus on advancing
the TC's work products, which are listed in [this
document](Work-Product-List.md).

## Standing Agenda Format

The agenda for working meetings, generally, is:

1.	**Introduction** 
    *	Chair info 
    *	Record attendance
    *	Link to work products page
    *	Review & approve agenda

2.	**Pull Requests for Agreement** 
    *   List any PRs that are ready to go in the order they were
        distributed (i.e., older goes first, incentive to get in
        early)
        * **Format:  list PRs directly on this agenda page, no sub-pages**
    *   Simple "Any objection or discussion?" on each PR 
        *	if none, merge the PR
        *	If any discussion, change PR to draft and defer to item 3 on agenda

3.	**Draft Pull Requests for Discussion** 
    *   List any PRs for discussion in the order they were
        distributed (i.e., older goes first, incentive to get in
        early), adding deferred PRs from item 2 last
        * **Format: List PRs on this page, create sub-agenda item (i.e., 3.1, 3.2, ...) with detailed information for discussion**
    *   Time-bound discussion depending on number to be discussed
        and amount of agenda time allocated to remaining agenda
        items
    *   Intent is to 
        *   (1) alert everyone to proposed changes and
        *   (2) reach consensus on issues that arise
    *   Defer resolution to email, Slack, later agenda items, and *ad
        hoc* meetings if concerns canâ€™t resolve in timeslot
    *   If draft PR is something discussed before and has no new
        changes, it can be skipped until changes have been made
        and/or consensus reached

4.	**Special Topics** 
    *   Dedicated agenda time (time bound) on a topic that was
        requested prior to meeting and added to agenda. In some
        meetings this might be 30 min dedicated to resolving some
        particularly thorny issue. Is other meetings, it might be
        skipped entirely.
        * **Format: List PRs on this page, create sub-agenda item (i.e., 3.1, 3.2, ...) with detailed information for discussion**

5.	**Work Product Status/Next Steps** 
    *   List all work products, in different order each meeting
        (see structure below)
    *   Time bound discussion per work product on what is
        happening and what needs to happen to get work product
        into either agenda items 2 or 3

6.	**Any Other Business**


## Agenda Coordination
 
Agendas are coordinated via a combination of: 
 1) discussion on the TC mail list, where work product editors
    and the TC co-chairs and secretary can coordinate which work
    products need discussion time at a particular working
    meeting, and 
 1) editing of the agenda in Lucid Meetings to capture the plans
    for a particular discussion. 

All TC members are encouraged to raise other agenda topics as
needed. We also have an #editors channel in Slack where anyone
interested in meeting planning can chime in. 

The Lucid Meetings settings for the working meetings permit
anyone invited to edit the agenda. This enables the editors for a
work product to directly edit portions  of the agenda relevant to
their items. The template for a work product discussion agenda
is:
 * Editors:  editor 1, editor 2
 * Link to the work product GitHub repository
 * Brief status summary: ... (with any relevant links)
 * GitHub issues and/or pull requests (PRs) up for discussion
 * Next steps: what's needed to progress toward Committee Specification (or OASIS Standard)

## Recording Outcomes

The outcome of working meeting discussions should be captured
primarily using GitHub mechanisms, through updates to issues and
PRs. Action items can be captured in Lucid Meetings. Work product
editors are also encouraged to send a brief summary of meeting
results to the TC mailing list to keep TC members apprised of
progress.
