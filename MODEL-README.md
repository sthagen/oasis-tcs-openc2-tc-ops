## README

_This file provides a template for creating a new README.md for an OpenC2 TC work product repository. The initial generic logo graphic should be replaced with one specific for the work product, and internal content should be edited to name, describe, and link to the proper information for the work product. GitHub links in the source should be edited to reference the repository for **this** work product._

### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Repository Organization :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

![branches](images/repo-branches.png)

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty.
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the [current working
  version]() of this work product.

> In the above bullet about the Working branch edit the `READMD.md` source to insert a link to the working version markdown file in the `working` branch of the repo.

More information about the TC's repository organizing conventions
and branching strategy can be found in our [Documentation
Norms](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/Documentation-Norms.md#433-configure-repository).
