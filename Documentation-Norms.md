# Documentation Norms for the OpenC2 Technical Committee

# 1 Foreword

This document provides informal, internal guidance for work product editors in the [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/) [OpenC2 Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2) (TC).  It captures the working processes and norms being used by the OpenC2 TC in the development of OpenC2 standards under OASIS auspices. OpenC2 standards include the language specification, actuator profiles, transfer specifications, etc., as well as other supporting [work products](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dWorkProduct) (the OASIS term for what a TC produces).

**What is an "Editor"?**  Excerpting from the OASIS Editor’s Manual (see Section 2), a work product editor is responsible for:

* Creating and maintaining documents that reflect the consensus of the TC and incorporating agreed-upon changes clearly and unambiguously

* Helping to find consensus positions and providing text that gets the TC to agreement

* Bringing up unresolved issues at TC meetings, suggesting resolutions, and incorporating approved text as appropriate

* Preparing documents for review, coordinating with TC Administration, and presenting the document to the Technical Committee for approval for a public review

* Create and maintain a public review comment log

The guide says "It’s safe to say that the role of editor is likely to be the most intensive job of any in the Technical Committee. In return, however, you will find your name on the front page of the published work, you will exert the greatest influence over the form and substance of the finished document, and you will be in the best position to develop relationships with other experts and thought leaders in the TC."

The document will gradually be honed to a more polished form, but will likely always be something of a "work in progress".

# 2 OASIS Guidance for Editors

Work product editors should become familiar with OASIS guidance on development of normative and non-normative products; here are links to important guidance documents:

* **OASIS Technical Committee Process:** OASIS has a structured process for the establishment of TCs and the development of work products by a TC. While a document editor doesn't need an understanding of the complete process, familiarity with 
[Section 2. TC Work Products](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#tcWorkProducts) will be helpful.

* **OASIS Editor's Manual:** On 5 September 2018 the OASIS Technical Advisory Board (TAB) announced version 1.0 of the OASIS Editor's Manual, to be shared with specification editors. The manual is captured in four Google Docs for now. Anyone with the link can add comments and the TAB welcomes feedback. Please feel free to comment directly to the documents. If you prefer, you can send your thoughts to tab-askthetab@lists.oasis-open.org. The Editor's Manual is published in four parts (about 30-35 total pages): 

    * **Part 1: [The Role of Editor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTartcAzlqidzrCxuXFFiwdRDKRipqMnNsMS24SZdjg/edit#heading=h.bi4fdsq13pue):**  explains the basics of the job you undertake when you volunteer to edit a work product.  

    * **Part 2: [The Editorial Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaYTQleiGMRA1vt2sLo1YUXqlGJe-JXgukJvSSlOhRI/edit#heading=h.bi4fdsq13pue):**  describes the work flow for TC work products from working draft through OASIS Standard.

    * **Part 3: [Document Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yA-wt2wB4NOpgoQ81VBfuJ1WPA1GK_BuddiVP_L6BnU/edit#heading=h.psw0b8lwn5fm):** covers the components of work products including required sections and considerations about whether to organize a work product as a single part or a multi-part work. 

    * **Part 4: [Work Product Preparation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10lt8f2pn_ebZTsWJiGYiWYzyo6NbjuTskvDcS2tSyPw/edit#):** covers lessons learned, tips, etc for preparing documents without errors.

* **Related guidance:** Other documents produced by the OASIS TAB address related topics: 

    * _[The OASIS Naming Directives](http://docs.oasis-open.org/specGuidelines/ndr/namingDirectives.html)_. To keep a vast collection of works like the content from OASIS TCs organized in a sensible manner requires some rules governing the organization and naming of work. This document lists the limitations and requirements that apply to filenames, directories in the OASIS libraries, structural organization of work, namespaces, titles and version numbering, etc.

    * _[Keyword Guidelines for OASIS Specifications and Standards](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/keyword-guidelines)_. Most normative content at OASIS uses RFC2119 keywords. (The exception is work planned to be submitted to a *de jure* standards organization like ISO at a later date.) This document provides guidance on how to most effectively use keywords with drafting specifications. 

    * _[Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses for OASIS Specifications](http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html)_. OASIS specifications require a section with clauses that an implementation must comply with in order to be deemed a conforming implementation. This document gives guidance on how to go about preparing these for your specification.

    * _[Proposed Interoperability Guidelines](https://wiki.oasis-open.org/tab/InteropGuide)_. These guidelines help you write specifications that are precise enough to ensure that implementations are interoperable.

    * _[W3C Recommendation Citation List for OASIS Editors](http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/w3c-recommendations-list/w3c-recommendations-list.html)_. This document lists current W3C Recommendations in proper citation format for easy cut-and-paste into OASIS specs.

    * _[IETF RFC Citation List for OASIS Editors](http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/ietf-rfc-list/ietf-rfc-list.html)_. This document lists current IETF RFCs in proper citation format for easy cut-and-paste into OASIS specs.

    * _[Checklist for Verifying the Editorial Quality of OASIS Specifications](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=54999)_. When you have a document ready to approve for publication, this document lists key checkpoints you can use to ensure that it is ready to go and avoid some common errors. This is the same checklist that OASIS staff and TAB use to review specification drafts during publication and public review. 

# 3 Work Product Development Overview

This section describes the process the OpenC2 TC is using in developing work products. 

## 3.1 Family of Documents

The OpenC2 Language Specification is the foundation of a family of documents that collectively define the language, tailor its use with specific cybersecurity functions, and describe how other protocols are used in a supporting manner (e.g., for message transfer). This family includes a variety of document types:

* Language Specification
* Architecture Specification (pending)
* Actuator Profiles
* Transfer Specifications
* Schemas

Documents of similar type (e.g., actuator profiles) within the family logically have similar content and organization, so familiarity with previously created OpenC2 specifications is helpful when developing a new work product. 

## 3.2 "Agile" document development concept

The OpenC2 TC has been using a development process inspired by agile software development concepts. Under this process, document editors work with the members of the applicable subcommittee to incrementally develop and gain consensus regarding the content of a work product. This process includes moderately frequent publication of [Working Drafts](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dWorkingDraft) (WDs) that are then presented to the OpenC2 TC for approval as [Committee Specification Drafts](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dCommitteeDraft) (CSDs). Approval of a CSD formalizes and documents TC consensus on the material from that increment of development.

Once the editors and SC agree that a work product is complete and mature, the remainder of its review and approval are governed by the OASIS TC Process for public review, approval as a Committee Specification, and eventual approval as an OASIS Standard (following additional public review). Sections [2.6](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#publicReview) through [2.8](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#OASISstandard) of the [TC Process document](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26) describe those aspects of work product development.

## 3.3 Work Product Development Sequence

The overall sequence for development of a work product, as currently performed within the OpenC2 TC, is as follows:

* Identify WP Need
* Determine WP name
* Request starter template and GitHub repository
* Upload template and configure repository
* Apply agile, incremental development (Cycle)
    * Intermittent WD releases / CSD approvals
* Conduct Public Review (Cycle)
* CS Approval & Publication

The next section and the Appendices provide detailed information about these steps.

# 4 OpenC2 TC Work Product Development Process

As of December 2018, the OpenC2 TC shifted to focus on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github) as our primary tool for the development of work products and has adopted [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (MD) as our preferred authoritative format for work products (AKA documents).   If you’re completely unfamiliar with GitHub, [Annex B](#annex-b-getting-comfortable-with-github) provides an introduction and links to other helpful information sources.

(NOTE:  The use of Google Docs as an initial development platform for work products remains available as an option; a script is available to export Google Docs to Markdown and can be used when the editor(s) is ready to shift to GitHub to mature the document.)

Markdown is a text-based language that uses a simple formatting syntax to make editing easy, the Markdown source very readable, and the processed output nicely formatted. Since OASIS uses GitHub repositories for version control, the OpenC2 TC is specifically using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-) (often shortened as GFM), the dialect of Markdown that is currently supported for user content on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise.

GitHub offers many useful features to support our process, including rich version control features, issue capture and discussion, easy editing of text-based formats, and ready availability of free and open-source tools to support a variety of working preferences. There are three types of GitHub repositories in use by the OpenC2 TC:

* **TC Product Repos:** For each TC-sponsored work product, OASIS TC Administration creates a GitHub repository (AKA "repo"), and assigns the editor(s) of the document as "maintainers". Maintainers have the privilege to [commit](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#commit) changes to the repository's contents, be those changes their own work or contributions from other TC members. Typically the maintainers of a TC work product repo will be the editors of the product plus the current co-chairs of the subcommittee under whose auspices the work product is developed.

* **TC Working Repos:** In addition to repos specific to individual work products, the TC has other repos to support its efforts, such as the capture of [use cases](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-usecases), and a repository to support development of [custom actuator profiles](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-cap) (which may eventually turn into TC work products and receive individual repos).

* **TC Open Repos:**  These are established by the TC to capture the development of (primarily) software related to the TC's objectives. 

This document is focused on the use of **TC Product Repos** to develop TC work products (e.g., specifications, committee notes).

## 4.1 Identify Work Product Need

The work of identifying and developing work products in the
OpenC2 TC has been delegated to the three subcommittees. Any
member can propose a work product, typically by presenting
their idea to the relevant subcommittee. Consensus in the
subcommittee is sufficient to initiate the creation of a
work product. The work product will then need a name and an
abstract in order to submit the request for a starter
document (naming and starter document requests are discussed
in the next section)

## 4.2 Assign Work Product Name

Once the need for a work product is established, the next
step in creating a new work product is to name the document
and create a shorthand for it. Give some thought to the
product name when requesting a starter document, as that
name will live on essentially forever. Consultation with the
associated SC co-chairs is recommended, as well as
familiarity with the _[OASIS Naming
Directives](http://docs.oasis-open.org/specGuidelines/ndr/namingDirectives.html)_.
Consultation with the OASIS TC Administration team is also
helpful, as they can assist with applying the naming
directives and help avoid collisions with the names of other
OASIS products.

The TC's work products can be broken into over-arching
documents (e.g., Language Specification, Architecture Specification) that
define OpenC2 overall, and supporting documents (e.g.,
actuator profiles, transfer specifications) that address
specific features and functions. To provide for consistency,
the following principles apply:
 - Overarching documents should spell out OpenC2 in their titles.
 - Supporting documents don't need to do so as they are
   dependent on the overarching documents.

The following example titles illustrate the application of
these principals:

- Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Language Specification
- Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification
- OpenC2 Actuator Profile for _cyberfunction_
- OpenC2 Transfer Specification for _protocol_


Since the TC name (i.e., "openc2") is already included in the URLs and GitHub repo names that OASIS assigns there is no need to include "openc2" or "oc2" in the shorthand name for the product (a lesson learned since the TC's first work products were named). A useful convention is to include the document type, so the following patterns are recommended:

* Actuator profiles:  `ap-<function shorthand>`
* Transfer specifications:  `transf-<protocol shorthand>`

> NOTE:  The initial actuator profile for stateless packet filtering and transfer specification for HTTPS do not follow these patterns, but the patterns are recommended for new specifications. If a new type of document is needed, the co-chairs of the associated subcommittee should be involved in determining the naming pattern for the new document type.

As an example, an actuator profile for anti-virus might have the shorthand of "ap-av", leading to:

* Repo name:  oasis-tcs / openc2-**ap-av**
* Document URL:  docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/**ap-av**/v1.0/**ap-av**-v1.0.html

The OASIS TC Administration team will enforce the shorthand 
name originally attached to a product when creating 
OASIS-published versions (e.g., committee specification drafts [CSDs]). 

Here are some example names from current committee work; 
the last two apply the naming conventions described above:

|  Document | Shorthand Name | Repo Name (openc2-...) |
| ---|:--:|:--:|
|  _Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Language Specification_ | oc2ls | …-oc2ls |
|  _Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Actuator Profile for Stateless Packet Filtering_ | oc2slpf | ...-apsc-stateless-packet-filter |
|  _Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTPS_ | open-impl-https | …-impl-https |
|  _Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via OpenDXL_ | transf-odxl | …-transf-odxl |
|  _Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via MQTT_ | transf-mqtt | ...-transf-mqtt |


## 4.3 Establish Development Environment

The development environment for a work product includes the
starter document template from OASIS and the work product's
repo, along with forks of the repo created by contributors
and tools the editors find useful. The process for
establishing and initializing the development environment is
illustrated in the figure below and described in the
following sections. The process utilizes the GitHub
repository branching concept further described in [section
4.3.3](#433-configure-repository)

> The OpenC2 TC is aware of and endorses the movement away
> from the use of `master` as the name of the repository's
> default branch. The TC intends to rename the default
> branches of its existing work product repositories once
> [GitHub makes tools available to simplify the
> process](https://github.com/github/renaming). This
> document presently uses `master` so that it aligns with
> the current content of the TC's GitHub repos.

### 4.3.1 Request Template

Once a new work product is identified and a product name selected, the next step in the process is to request a template / starter document from OASIS. For a markdown-formatted product, a companion request is made for a GitHub repo in the TC's space (i.e., [oasis-TCs / openc2-...](https://github.com/oasis-tcs?utf8=✓&q=openc2&type=&language=)). While it might seem reasonable to launch a new work product by cloning an existing TC product, following the OASIS process has several advantages:

* Encourages the TC and the editor(s) to think through naming the work product appropriately

* Creates awareness of the new work product in OASIS TC Administration, and gives them an opportunity to identify any possible problems (e.g., name collisions with other OASIS work [which has happened])

* Ensures that the work product begins from a template that reflects current OASIS formats and guidelines

Requesting a template / starter document creates *no* obligation for the TC or the editor(s) that the work product will be completed.

Both the template / starter document and a GitHub repo are requested using forms on the [TC Admin Requests](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tc-admin-requests) page. Any TC member may place the requests, but typically this will be handled by some one of the document editor(s), the SC co-chairs, or the TC Secretary. Editors who are uncertain how to proceed should request assistance from the Secretary. Submitting a TC Admin request requires login with the submitter's OASIS Kavi credentials. The relevant forms on the TC Admin Requests page are:

* Request a template / starter document (use the notes section of the request form to request Markdown-formatted starter document)

* Request a TC GitHub version control instance be created

> NOTE:  Links to Individual request forms are not provided here to allow for future changes by TC Admin. Use the TC Admin Requests link above to get to the list of forms.

The editors of the work product should also be named as the maintainers of the GitHub repository, so every editor needs a GitHub account. Document editors must be familiar with the OASIS guidance on using [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work). In particular, the repo maintainers must enforce that contributions to the work product are only from TC members and that the Intellectual Property policy under which the TC operates is enforced.

In response to the request for a template / starter document, TC Admin will send a message to the TC mail list with an attached ZIP file containing:

* a Markdown file (.md) -- this is the main template or starter document, customized with titles and other elements for this Work Product
* an HTML version generated from the markdown - for reference
* a directory /styles containing an HTML style sheet (.css)
* a directory /images containing an example image file
* a "README" text file with important instructions

The editors / maintainers are responsible for unzipping the attachment and populating the repo with the starter document content for the work product. The email with the starter document package contains other valuable info, which the editor(s) should also read (the same information is included in the README text file).

### 4.3.2 Request Repository

When requesting a repository (AKA "TC GitHub version control instance") for a work product, it is necessary to identify the maintainer(s) to be assigned to the new repo, and provide a description of the work product. OASIS TC Administration will take care of creating the repo, assigning the maintainers, and notifying the maintainers once the repo has been created. A list of the TC's work product repos and the maintainers associated with each can be found on the OASIS [Teams](https://github.com/orgs/oasis-tcs/teams?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=openc2) page on GitHub.

### 4.3.3 Configure Repository

The following branching scheme has been worked out to
facilitate the configuration control of work products
developed by the OpenC2 TC. The two branches in the
repo are intended to organize the work as follows:

* The *Working* branch contains the newest content for the
  work product, material that is actively being developed,
  and subject to potentially frequent and significant
  change. Contributors to the work product should target
  their inputs to the Working branch. Working Draft (WD)
  versions of the work product are identified using the
  GitHub Release feature, and the WD content is uploaded to
  the TC's document store at OASIS .

* The *Master* branch contains TC-approved CS and OASIS
  Standard versions of the work product. The Master branch
  is initially populated with the starter document template
  supplied by OASIS. Until the first CS is approved, the
  Master branch will only contain the template rather than a
  complete version of the work product.

### Figure 2: Work Product Repository Branching Concept

![Work Product Repo Branching Concept](images/versioning-concept.png)

> [Figure 2 Source (Google Draw File)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1cJDmBxwaSZnGhqCZqz2O5XaXuxOIU3XMP5caE9o_Gzo/edit)

Figure 2 assumes a Committee Specification has been approved
(the v1.0 document) and work is proceeding on a future
version (the v1.1 document). For a new work product, as
shown in Figure 1, above, the `master` branch would be
populated with the OASIS-supplied template, and then the
`working` branch created from the `master` so that the
template is available in the `working` branch as the
starting point. Note that this branching strategy is
intended for the _work product_ managed in the repo. There
may be reasons to make changes directly to the `master`
branch, such as to update the information in the repo's
README.md file.

#### 4.3.3.1 README.md Content Update

When OASIS creates a repository for the work product it will be populated three files:

* **CONTRIBUTING.md:** rules and restrictions on contributing to this repository

* **LICENSE.md:**  information on applicable OASIS policies and Intellectual Property (IP) constraints.

* **README.md:**  overview of the repository's contents and purpose. This file is displayed by default when anyone loads the repository home page (NOTE: this is different than the README.txt in the starter template).

These files must remain when the starter document contents from the ZIP file are added to the repository. The editor(s) should modify the README.md file to convey useful information about the repository and the work product it contains. In particular:

* The OASIS default includes a section labeled "Further Description of this Repository" where the editors can add information

* An explanation of the branching convention being used, and where to find the most current version of the work product should be added; here is suggested text in markdown format:

* * *

```
This repository is organized with two branches:

 * The *_Working_* branch contains work product 
 material that is actively being developed, and 
 subject to potentially frequent and significant 
 change. Contributors to the work product should 
 target their inputs to the Working branch.

  * The *_Master_* branch contains TC-approved 
[Committee Specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dCommitteeSpec) (CS) or [OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dOASISstandard) 
versions of the work product. Until the first CS 
is approved, the Master branch will not contain 
a complete version of the work product.

  * Releases in this repository correspond to 
  Working Draft versions that have been uploaded 
  to OASIS, including Working Draft versions 
  that have been approved as Committee Specification 
  Drafts (CSDs).
```
 
 * * *


#### 4.3.3.2 Create and Populate Branches

When the repo is available the maintainers should populate
the `master` branch with the starter document received from TC
Administration (including the subdirectories and supporting
files), then create a `working` branch from the `master`
branch. Activity to develop the product then proceeds as
described above. The `master` branch will only have the
initial template until a CS is approved, at which point the
maintainers populate it with the current CS version. Each
time a new CS is approved the `master` branch is updated.

Work-in-progress is always handled in the `working` branch,
using the standard GitHub mechanisms of forking the work
product repository and creating pull requests (PRs) with
contributions. When Working Drafts (WDs) are declared, the
GitHub Release feature is used to created the WD package for
upload to OASIS.  If a WD is approved as a Committee
Specification Draft (CSD) the editors should edit the
Release description to (i) record that the WD was approved
and the CSD version, and (ii) add a link to the published
CDS at OASIS. A link to the approval ballot can also be
added to the release description.

## 4.4 Incremental Development

Developing a document on GitHub requires the editor to develop a level of comfort with two distinct skills:

* Authoring a document using [Github-Flavored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#GFM) [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for formatting
* Using GitHub / Git procedures for version control

Document creation using GitHub is inherently text-based. 
It is possible for an editor to do all of their work 
entirely within GitHub, but for many it may be more 
comfortable and/or convenient to create a local copy 
of the repository to enable use of preferred text editors, 
working offline, etc. [Annex A](#annex-a-links-to-useful-software) 
provides suggestions for useful software. [Annex B](#annex-b-getting-comfortable-with-github) 
provides an overview of establishing an environment with 
a related set of repositories to enable working in this 
manner and a link to an excellent explainer; other resources 
can readily be found by searching on-line. TC members are 
also happy to share their GitHub knowledge, and GitHub 
provides an extensive [help](https://help.github.com/en) library.

### 4.4.1 Creating & Posting a Working Draft

A frequent occurrence in developing a work product is the
posting of a "Working Draft" (WD) version to OASIS. This
must be done, in particular, any time a ballot is to be held
to approve a document as a Committee Specification Draft
(CSD), which happens periodically during our "agile"
document development process. The GitHub
[Releases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
feature is used to tag a WD within GitHub and to help create
the WD package for upload to OASIS. The creation of a WD is
a two-step process:

1. In the `working` branch,  refresh the document's table of
   contents (see next section) and ensure the document title
   page is updated to reflect the correct WD number and
   date.

1. Use the GH Releases feature to create the release package.

#### 4.4.1.1 Document Updates for WD
As final preparation to create a WD, editors should
* update the WD sequence number and date
information on the title page so that they are current, and
* update the TOC within the Markdown file prior to declaring a release to create a WD. 

[pandoc](#annex-a-links-to-useful-software) is a flexible
document conversion tool that can created the TOC
in a local file, as follows:

`pandoc -f gfm --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o <outfile> <infile>`

where `<infile>` and `<outfile>` are markdown files. The
`<infile>` is the markdown file from GitHub containing the
working draft content.  The TOC will be added to the
`<outfile>` at the beginning of the file, and the editors
must manually move it to the proper place in the document.
There may be other clean-up required of the TOC (e.g.,
extraneous headings); the editor should review it carefully,
delete unwanted content, and confirm that all internal
document links work properly.

#### 4.4.1.2 Create GH Release and Upload to OASIS

The editor uses GitHub to [create a
release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases),
and assigns it an appropriate identification tag, typically
identifying the target version and the WD revision number
(e.g., v1.0_WD05). GitHub creates a ZIP file containing the
contents of the selected branch of the repository at the
time of the release's creation. That ZIP file is the basis
for the WD package.

The essential contents of the WD package are

* the Markdown file for the document, and 
* any image files, which should be in the /images folder. 

The editor has the option to create and include an HTML
file; this can be done using `pandoc` and the CSS files
supplied by OASIS in the template / starter document
package. While the HTML file is optional, creating one can
be helpful in that the HTML version provides an
easily-readable rendered version of the markdown file that
can be reviewed in a browser for quality control purposes.
`pandoc` comes into play again here to create the HTML file.
With the `working` branch checked out and the directory
containing the work product markdown file as the current
directory, the following command will create the HTML file:

`pandoc -f gfm -t html <filename>.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.css -s -o <filename>.html --metadata title="Title of Specification Version X.Y"`

The editor should remove extraneous material from the ZIP
file (e.g., the image sources in the /src folder) prior to
uploading the ZIP file to OASIS as a WD.

## 4.5 Public Review Comment Handling

An essential part of the OASIS standards development process is public review of TC work products, as documented in sections [2.6](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#publicReview) and [2.8.2](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#OSpublicRev) of the TC Process. During a public review, comments are submitted via the TC mail list (for TC members) and the TC public comments list (for non-TC members). The TC is required to:

> _acknowledge the receipt of each comment, track the comments received, and post to its primary e-mail list the disposition of each comment at the end of the review period. (TC Process, Sections 2.6 & 2.8.2)_

Disposition of comments can include any of (i) altering a document to address a comment, (ii) deferring a comment to future work (e.g., a later version of the document), or (iii) determining that no change is required. The OASIS requirement is to provide an artifact, posted to the TC's mail list, that records the TC disposition decisions.  If no comments are received during a public review, an email recording that result is sent to the TC mail list as the artifact.

The OpenC2 TC is handling public review with a hybrid
approach of a Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM) captured in a
Google Sheet to maintain an overall record of comment
disposition, along with the use of GitHub issues in the
associated work product  repo to capture the details of how each
comment is addressed. The CRM connects the original comment
emails in the public archives of the TC and comment mail
lists with the GitHub issues and, if appropriate, pull
requests where the details of comment disposition are
recorded. When the process is complete, the CRM is exported
to a PDF that is sent to the TC mail list as the definitive
public artifact recording the outcomes.

The OpenC2 TC has a [CRM
template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kk6FOIHCs4M8KsLzSywwnsrMbarpIVM2m0T2ZC7h0zc/edit#gid=0)
in the `admin > template` folder on our [Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByY7rMsnC7rrY1JEMlBLckNXTG8).
Editors handling public review comments should make a copy
of the template, rename it appropriately, and move it to the
folder for the SC associated with the document.  The CRM
template columns are as follows:

|  Column | Usage |
| :----: | ---- |
|  Item # | A tracking identifier for the comment. Editor's discretion for assigning. It can be helpful to put this identifier into the titles of associated GitHub issues and pull requests for easy cross-referencing.  Recommended use is to combine a shorthand for the document with a sequence number. Using a leading hundreds (or thousands) value for the sequence number can key it to a particular public review (e.g., HTTPS-101 is the first comment from the first public review, HTTPS-203 is the third comment from the second public review).  The order of comments in the CRM has no significance. |
|  Source | Individual or organization that submitted the comment. |
|  Email Link | Web link to the specific email containing the comment in the OASIS public archive of the appropriate mail list (i.e., OpenC2 TC mail list public archive, OpenC2 TC comment mail list public archive |
|  Section | Section of the document where the target of the comment appears. |
|  Page | Page where the target of the comment appears (usually from a PDF version of the document).  Optionally a column may be inserted for the line where the target of the comment appears, if line numbering was applied to the public review document. |
|  Comment (or Comment Summary) | The comment text or (editor's discretion) a summary of the comment. If a summary is used, the editor should: Use care to correctly capture the intent of comment, and Include the full text of the comment in the GitHub issue where it is addressed, to avoid any ambiguity. |
|  GitHub Issue Link | Web link to the GitHub issue where the comment will be discussed and disposition recorded. |
|  Resolution Summary | A brief summation of the disposition (e.g., "ACCEPTED: added language …", DEFERRED to later version). Having this summary in the CRM is important so that the permanent artifact in the OASIS archive meets the requirement to "post … the disposition of each comment", without need to refer to other sources. |
|  GitHub Change Link | Web link to the GitHub pull request where the specific document changes related to the comment, if any, are identified. |
|  Material? | Editor's / SC's assessment of whether any changes made to address the comment represent material changes to the work product. Material changes made to a document as a result of a public review require that the updated document undergo a subsequent public review. |


Our editors have found it useful to employ GitHub's [labels](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-labels) feature when organizing issues from public review comments for discussion. Labels can be used to identify:

* Which public review generated a comment (e.g., PR01, PR02)
* A set of issues planned for discussion at an upcoming meeting
* A set of issues that all relate to a particular topic with a work product (e.g., Group_Actions)
* Issues that have tentatively reached resolution (e.g., Candidate_For_Closure)
* Issues that are being deferred (e.g., Future)

Examine the issue labels in existing work product repos for additional examples. GitHub creates a default set of labels for a repository; these are oriented toward the standard software development use case, and editors should feel free to delete them if desired.

## 4.6 CS Approval & Publication

The approval of a CS is governed by Section [2.7](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#committeeSpec) of the TC Procedures. Once a public review has been completed without material changes to the document, TC can request OASIS TC Administration conduct a [Special Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dSpecialMajority) to approve the document as a CS. Once the CS is approved, TC Administration will create the CS version of the document in multiple formats, and publish an announcement on the OASIS home page. The work product maintainers should upload the CS versions of the product to the repository’s `master` branch, with correspondent relevant updates to the README.md file.

# Appendix B: Getting Comfortable with GitHub

For those unfamiliar with using GitHub and Git, [this article](https://medium.com/hackernoon/github-for-chimpanzees-and-a-short-rant-against-scientists-868fb04e5e4a) provides a helpful 
(albeit colorfully presented and highly opinionated) explanation of the concepts and processes 
(feel free to skip the introductory <Rant> and jump to the GitHub-oriented meat 
[search for "What is a repository?"]).  Another good introduction is [this article](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/) from someone who isn’t primarily a programmer.

If you're unfamiliar with the use of Git and GitHub for version control, the terminology 
and process can be a little bit hard to grasp. The articles linked above can definitely help.  
The following diagram illustrates the process of connecting GitHub repos and a local Git 
repo to work on products.  The process steps are listed below the diagram, with links 
to the [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) 
for definitions of key terminology.

#### Figure 3: Relationships Among GitHub Repositories

![GitHub Repo Relationships](images/GitHub-Repo-Relationships.png)

> [Figure 3 Source (Google Draw File)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/10M4foaPrE3t1XCQGQ3Tr-cBVFmj5Zm9PccGUkuPeop8/edit)


1. GitHub: A Project Owner creates a [repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#repository) ("repo") for the document. This the "master" version of the document, and the repo is the "[Upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#upstream) Repo". In the case of OpenC2 TC work products, these repos are created and managed by OASIS TC Administration, with one or more TC members established as maintainers for the repo.

2. GitHub: A Contributor creates a [forked copy](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#fork) of the Upstream Repo in their own GitHub account. This repo will contain a copy of the document as it existed in the Upstream Repo at the time the fork was created. The contributor can work purely in this document on the web, or create a local [Git](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#git) repo (step #3) where they can, for example, edit with their favorite text editor or Git-/GitHub-aware tool set.

> NOTE: The default names in the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork) for the repos described in Steps 1 and 2 here are "upstream" for the "OASIS" repo, and "origin" for the "Fork" repo. The instructions in [C.3](#c3-clone-local-repository-from-personal-fork) describe using `git` commands to establish the "OASIS" and "Fork" names used here.

3. Local: A Contributor "[clones](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#clone)" their GitHub fork of the document to a Git environment on their local system.

4. Local: The Contributor can edit document content and create additional content, including graphics and other files in their local environment.  Git is used on the local machine command line to update the local repo to reflect new and modified content.

5. Local: When the Contributor wishes to submit material to change the master document, they use the Git "[push](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#push)" command (local command line) (NOTE:  Some local editing tools, such as the Microsoft Visual Studio Code editor, have built-in support for pushing changes to GitHub, eliminating the need to use the command line.) to replicate their content to their fork repo. This updates the fork repo to match the local repo.

6. GitHub: The Contributor creates a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#pull-request) (PR) from their GitHub fork repo back to the upstream repo to contribute their proposed changes to the master document. Pull requests can target the master branch of the upstream repo or any other chosen [branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#branch) (e.g., the "working" branch being used to accumulate changes toward a future version of a document).

7. GitHub: The Project Owner can accept a Pull Request to merge the Contributor's material into the specified branch of the upstream repo. This modifies the upstream document by incorporating the Contributor's additions and deletions. GitHub offers the Project Owner the option to edit the contribution before merging the pull request.

GitHub has no obvious mechanism to update a fork repo with changes from the upstream repo. A straightforward approach is to delete the fork and create a new one. If you are also working with a local Git repo, however, the Contributor can add the upstream repo as a remote repo. This creates a linkage among all three repos. The Contributor can then, at any time, "Fetch" the upstream repo to update the local repo to be consistent, and then "Push" the local repo to the fork repo on GitHub to synchronize it. The processes to [configure an upstream repo](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/), [synchronize upstream changes to a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/), and [push to your GitHub fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) are described in GitHub help.

An easier approach, and one that’s useful if you have a fork on GitHub but aren’t doing local editing with Git, is to apply the [method described here](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) to create a pull request from the upstream repo to the fork.

> NOTE: experimenting with that method, it seems to create something of a
loop condition between the fork and the upstream repo, where the commit
of the PR from upstream to fork shows up as the fork being a commit ahead, and
creating a new fork --> upstream PR just perpetuates the problem. So deleting
and recreating the fork may still be a cleaner approach.

# Appendix C: GitHub- / Markdown-Based Process & Procedures

> This section is currently incomplete

"feature branches" are normally worked in forks of the "working" branch. They can be related to official Issues or just new features that someone wants to be considered. To consider the feature, a Pull Request is created against the "working" branch of the "upstream" repository

Committees can publish Working Drafts to the TC documents on
OASIS. The current commit of the "working" branch is tagged
as a GitHub Release.

The TC can vote to approve a Working Draft as a Committee
Specification Draft. Once approved by the TC, the Release
description can be edited to record the approval and link to
the published version of the CSD at OASIS. Work product
editors should compare the front matter of the
OASIS-published CSD to the version in their `working` branch
and make any appropriate updates to the working version.

Same with CSPRD…

Same with CS…

# Appendix D: Markdown Formatting Conventions

Markdown is text-oriented and intended to be both easily readable in its raw form, and easily rendered into HTML or other more visually pleasing forms. GitHub provides some guides for using GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM):

* [Basic markdown writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (covers most of what you need to know; somewhat more detailed than the overview provided below)

* GFM overview:  [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) -- a quick guide to the most-used formatting features; will answer most questions.

* GFM spec:  [https://github.github.com/gfm/](https://github.github.com/gfm/) -- a detailed formal specification of GFM, more useful to programmers than editors, but can help with troubleshooting.

This section provides a quick reference to the GFM features most used in preparing OpenC2 work products. 

## D.1 Headings

Section headings in GFM are indicated by leading pound signs / hash marks on a line:

```
# This is a Level 1 heading
```
# This is a Level 1 heading

```
## This is a Level 2 heading
```
## This is a Level 2 heading

The maximum header level is six. A blank line is not required between a heading and the text that follows it. A blank line is required between paragraphs of ordinary text.

OpenC2 TC documents use [decimal outline numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)#Decimal_outline) (1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.). At present, editors will need to manually add section numbers to the heading lines in their documents, e.g,

```
# 1.0 Heading 1
# 2.0 Another Heading 1
## 2.1 Heading 2
## 2.2 Another Heading 2
```

We are investigating tools that may make this easier.

The template document supplied by OASIS also uses hash marks to highlight heading lines in the up-front boilerplate material. Document editors should leave those hash marks in place in order not to disturb OASIS formatting; however, be aware that those lines will create table-of-contents (TOC) entries that will need to be manually removed from the TOC.

## D.2 Emphasis: Bold and Italic Text

Text can be emphasized by surrounding it with paired markers, either underlines or asterisks.  Single markers produce italic text, double markers produce bold text.  Examples:

```
*This text will be italic*

_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**

__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

## D.3 Hyperlinks and Section Cross-links

A hyperlink in a GFM document is entered as follows:  `[text to display](link)`.  A simple example would be 

```
[this links to Google]([https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com))
```
which produces [this links to Google](https://www.google.com).

Cross-links to a section header within a document use the same hyperlink structure with a specific format for the `(link)` portion. An example:  

```
[3.2.2 HTTP Usage](#322-http-usage). 
```
[3.2.2 HTTP Usage](#322-http-usage). 

The text to display is the same as with any other link, but the (link) portion has 

* a single leading hash mark, 

* the section number with punctuation removed, and 

* the section name in lower case with all spaces replaced with hyphens. 

When using pandoc to create a TOC (as described below), all of the TOC entries are automatically created using this format so that the TOC is a collection of links to the document's sections. We've noticed that pandoc's TOC creation doesn't always correctly handle headings that contain characters like ampersands (&) and forward and back slashes, so a quality control check of the links it produces is important.

## D.4 Images

Images are inserted using the hyperlink form with a leading exclamation point. The text to display portion is treated as the alternative text for the image. The link can be relative, so it can easily be pointed to the /images folder included in the OASIS starter document.  An example image link:  

```
![This is an image.](./images/AnImage.png)
```

## D.5 Figure and Table numbering

TBD

## D.6 Code Examples

Where normal document text will be rendered in a proportional font, text intended to be understood as code is usually formatted in a fixed-width font.  Code formatting is used two ways: 

1. to highlight terms in-line in the text, and 

2. to format an example block of code distinctly from normal document text. 

In-code code is surrounded by single backticks:  `CodeWord`.  Code examples are surrounded by leading and trailing marker of three backticks: ```<block of code>```.  Text between leading and trailing backtick code markers will be displayed in a fixed font with a shaded background.  An example of block code:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2018 22:15:00 GMT
Content-type: application/openc2-cmd+json;version=1.0
X-Request-ID: id_1234
{   
    "action": "contain",
    "target": {
        "user_account": {
            "user_id": "fjbloggs",
            "account_type": "windows-local"
        }
    }
}
```

## D.7 Editor's Notes

During the development of a document there is often a need for the editor to provide explanation of work in progress or an indicator of the planned content of a section. The GFM block quote function is used for this, by preceding the relevant line(s) with a greater-than symbol (>).

```
> This text will be rendered as a block quote.
```
> This text will be rendered as a block quote.

## D.8 Ordered and Unordered Lists

Lists entries are identified by a leading character to signal that it's a list item. An asterisk (*) is used for unordered list items, and a number with a period (1.) for ordered list items. Nesting / hierarchy is shown by indenting subordinate list entries.  Examples:

An unordered list:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

```
An ordered list:
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b



For indentation to work properly, the list entry marker for the indented item must fall under the text of unindented item above. Hence, in the example above, the indented items are indented by three columns to align with the text (the "I" in "Item …") of the unindented item above.

## D.9 Tables

Tables are created with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. There must be at least 3 hyphens in each column of the header row. You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.

```
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |


GFM offers additional flexibility in formatting tables, the details are described [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/organizing-information-with-tables).

## D.10 "short lines"

When GitHub displays a diff, it's doing a line-by-line comparison, and recall the tool was created for software version control. Lines of code are typically short. In a document, if a paragraph is one very long line, it's much harder for GitHub to easily display the line-in / line-out changes, so it's helpful to break the text into shorter lines to make changes more visible. 

## D.11 Graphics

When creating graphics for a work product, editors should favor approaches that leave an editable original file, ideally in an open format, available to TC for future use. The goal is to ensure that a graphic can be edited for use in new document versions. The suggested approach for graphic handling is:

* Create a folder in the document repo to hold editable image sources (e.g., `/src`)

* Create images using an open source or widely available tool (see below)

* Export images for use in document from the image editor in a suitable form (e.g., PNG, JPEG), and place those images in the `/images` folder in the document repo so that they can be linked into the document

* Place the corresponding editable source files for the image in the `/src` folder

For images created and stored purely in web-based tools (e.g., Google Draw), create a file (e.g., SourceLinks.md) in the `/src` folder, and populate that file with brief descriptions of the images and corresponding links to the original image file in, e.g., the TC's Google Drive space.

Some suggestions for image editing / creation tools:

* Diagrams.net, [a free, on-line diagramming tool](https://www.diagrams.net/) similar to Visio / Gliffy / LucidChart; 

* Gravit Designer, "full featured" [vector editor](https://www.designer.io/en/), has free and pro versions

* Vector diagramming / [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)-based tools like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

* Google Draw for diagrams created in the TC's OASIS Google Drive space

* Well-known office application drawing tools (e.g., PowerPoint, LibreOffice)

## D.12 Table of Contents Creation

The [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) document processing and conversion tool is used to create tables of contents (TOC). This requires the [installation](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) of pandoc, and a local copy of the Markdown file. If the editor has created a local git repository for the document, the Markdown file will be there. Otherwise the editor must download a copy of the files from GitHub.

A simple pandoc command generates a table of contents:  

```
pandoc -f gfm --toc -s -o <outfile> <infile>
```

The TOC will be created at the very beginning of the output file.  Heading to appear as TOC entries are identified within the Markdown text file by lines with leading hash marks. The template / starter document from OASIS also uses hash marks in the up-front material to provide emphasis and structure to their boilerplate content. Clean-up of the pandoc-generated TOC requires the editor to:

* Remove all TOC entries associated with OASIS template items

* Move the TOC from the beginning of the file to the proper location, just before section 1.0 of the document (i.e., before the TC-created content)

When generating a new working draft (WD) for posting to OASIS, it is prudent to generate a current TOC, clean it up, and replace any previous TOC with the current version

# Appendix E: Google Document Formatting Standards (Legacy)

While the OpenC2 TC is no longer primarily using Google
Documents to collaboratively develop documents, that process
was used successfully for some time, and a script is
available to export a Google Document to Markdown
(specifically GitHub-Flavored Markdown [GMF]) to create the
authoritative version for final TC approval and publication.
This appendix preserves the TC’s best practices for
initially developing work products using Google Docs.
Former TC member Jason Romano created the [script for
exporting Google
Docs](https://github.com/romanojd/gdoc-markdown-converter).


A Google Docs add-on called Paragraph Styles+ (PS+) is very useful to manage decimal outline numbering when developing work products in Google Documents. With the shift to using GFM for creating the TC’s authoritative versions, the visual formatting aspects of PS+ are no longer relevant, but its utility for renumbering remains helpful.

## E.1 Section Numbering

OASIS documents use [decimal outline numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)#Decimal_outline). The use of Paragraph Styles+ makes this much easier. The TC uses "Annex" for supplement section to documents (e.g., examples, acronym lists, acknowledgements). Annex titles get Heading 1 formatting, which means Paragraph Styles+ will number them; we edit out those numbers during the publishing process.

## E.2 Figure & Table Numbering

*(need conventions for figure & table numbering)*

## E.3 Acknowledgement Sections

The Acknowledgements section should be the penultimate Annex, before the document revisions.  The OpenC2 TC's standard for entries in Acknowledgements sections is 

* Firstname Lastname, Org

sorted alphabetically by last name.  For example:

* Joseph Brule, National Security Agency.

* David Lemire, G2, Inc.

* Jason Romano, General Dynamics

Typically, document editors list any person who either voted or provided a comment via Github, Google Docs or via a ballot.  

## E.4 Hash Marks for Markdown Headings

David Lemire: What is the significance of lines that have leading hash marks?

Jason Romano: That's Markdown code for heading styles. It's a quick hack to differentiate between numbered and un-numbered headings. I may be able to remove that now that I'm using _Paragraph Styles+_ to manage section numbers. I'll experiment with that.

Nope. Now I remember. If I call it a "Heading" then _Paragraph Styles+_ wants to give it a number. When the document is converted to Markdown, the hash marks get interpreted as Headings, so the Markdown looks fine. The HTML and PDF versions will be taken from the Markdown. So only the Google Doc will look a little weird.

David Lemire: So # texttextext and something styled Heading 1 are both Heading one in MD, and the numbering comes from PS+? Either way I guess I just leave the hash marks alone.

Jason Romano: For the most part, you won't have to worry about the hash marks, because they should only show up in the front matter which should be static and the appendices. You'll want to manually add appendix numbering: D.1, D.2, D.2.1, etc.

Using PS+ to apply heading format to Annexes and their subsections will result in something like this:


## E.5 Markdown Considerations During Publishing

**TBSL:** inspecting the Google Doc to Markdown export results, some of the key points are here:

Formatting a trailing space:  if in the Google doc a trailing space is formatted, e.g., bold or italic, that will cause glitches in the rendering of the markdown file.  Example, with a $ sign replacing the trailing space in the Google Doc source; note that the $ is italic, but "we" isn't:

* In Google doc:  … in this *test document$*we include …, leads to

* Markdown:  … in this _test document _we include

The fix is to clear the formatting on the trailing space in the Google document and repeat the Markdown export.

Hash marks for headings

Limitations on table formatting

* Markdown doesn't render lists inside of table cells. Need to manually format with numbers or asterisks if you need something like that.

* If a table immediately follows a list in a Google Doc, the Markdown export script (as of Sept 2018) fails to insert a necessary blank line between the last list item and the table. The MD file needs to edited to manually add a blank line between the list and the table.

* * *


**Clean-up:**

* Move GDoc process to an Annex as the alternative approach?

    * Can strip out all of the Paragraph Styles+ formatting specifics, since formatting is now going to be handled by MD rendering and HTML CSS.

        * Need to confirm that GDoc Heading styles suffice for Jason's markdown conversion script

    * Probably still need the comment control script

    * Definitely need the MD export script
