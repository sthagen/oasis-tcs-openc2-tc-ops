# Current (as of late 2020) OASIS Document Template

In late 2020 OASIS updated their standard document template for a
work product. The update notably re-arranged the contents of an
OASIS specification / standard from the previous format. This
description provides a quick overview of the new format; new work
products should request a starter document from OASIS as
described in Section 4.3.1 of the TC's [Documentation
Norms](./Documentation-Norms.md), to ensure that new products are alwasy begun using current OASIS guidance.

OASIS guidance for application of the new format is:
> New stages of your existing specifications don't have to be
> modified to use the new templates, but you should be using the
> "2020style" for any new work, including new Version numbers of
> the existing specifications.

The outline of a specification in the new format is as follows:

---
