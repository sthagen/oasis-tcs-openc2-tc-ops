# Secretary's Notes on Meeting Scheduling

#### (Updated March 2025)

The [OpenC2 TC](https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=a34c9baf-48b2-44c5-a567-018dc7d32296)'s
routine meeting schedule is described in the [General Member
Information](./General-Member-Info.md) document. The following notes capture
helpful details regarding the meeting scheduling process.

Two systems are involved in scheduling OpenC2 TC meetings:

* The OASIS Community Platform is the system of record for OASIS TC operations.
* The [Lucid Meetings](https://meet.lucidmeetings.com/) platform the OpenC2 TC
uses to conduct TC and working meetings.  

The Lucid Meetings [Fundamentals: Start Here](http://support.lucidmeetings.com/support/solutions/folders/16000049332)
page provides information describing how things are organized in Lucid. One key to
efficient scheduling in Lucid are to update (1) the meeting agenda template and
(2) the room membership prior to scheduling a meeting series. Lucid uses the
metaphor of Meeting Rooms for organizations. All of the actions described below
will be done in the OpenC2 TC "room".

## General Notes

* All OpenC2 meetings (both monthly TC and "weekly" working meetings) are
  scheduled in *both* OASIS & Lucid. The OASIS invitation allows members to RSVP
  for meetings, which is a pre-requisite for recording their attendance. The
  Lucid invitation provides the necessary information to join each meeting
  (members can RSVP to Lucid but there is no particular utility for doing so).

* The TC schedules its recurring meeting series in 6-month blocks (April-September
  and October-March)

* Scheduling the five meeting series for a 6-month block generates a flurry of
  calendar invitation emails. Consider sending a "warning order" email to the
  [TC mail list](mailto:OASIS-openc2@ConnectedCommunity.org) so that members
  aren't surprised.

* The repeating meeting setting for each series should be _Monthly / Same Day of
  Week_ in both the OASIS and Lucid Meetings systems. This setting provides for
  meetings to occur on, for example, the third Wednesday of month.

* Consider use a tracking matrix (example below), checking
  off each meeting series as it is scheduled to ensure completeness.

## Lucid Meetings Agenda Templates

  * Lucid provides a rich system for creating and using meeting agenda templates, found
    in the Open C2 TC "room" in the Meeting Templates section of the Settings
    tab. The TC has agenda templates for the OpenC2 Monthly meeting series and the
    Working Meeting series.

![Meeting Template Management](./images/Meetings-manage-templates.png)

  * There are a total of five meeting series to be scheduled:

    * Working meetings (which occur three times per month) require scheduling a
      series for each session (i.e., 1st Wednesday, 2nd Wednesday, 4th Wednesday
      are scheduled as three separate series). When scheduling, apply the
      Working Meeting agenda template to all three of these series.

    * Monthly TC meeting's first and second sessions likewise require scheduling
      a series for each session. 

      * Apply the OpenC2 Monthly agenda template to the
      first session meeting series. 
      * Apply the Lucid gallery Blank/Quick Call
      template to the second session meeting series. 

  * Lucid allows copying the agenda
    from a previous meeting into an individual meeting. Each month after the
    first TC Meeting session has completed a facilitator should copy the agenda from the
    first session into the second session so that the meetings have consistent
    agendas (updates can be made to the second session agenda after copying if
    needed). To copy the agenda, starting at the Dashboard:
    1. Go to the second session meeting for that month
    2. Select the *More* tab
    3. Scroll down to *Manage the meeting process*
    4. Select *Copy the agenda from another meeting* (this will display a
       collection of tiles for recent meetings both in the current series
       [first row] and other series [second and subsequent rows])
    5. Find the meeting with the agenda you want to copy and click `Use Agenda`
       at the bottom of that meeting's tile (typically this will be the first tile under *Other
       Recent Meetings*)

  * If a meeting series needs its agenda template updated for the remaining
    meetings in the series, the process is:
    1. Make the desired updates to the agenda template
    2. Open the next scheduled meeting in the series
    3. Click on the pulldown next to the meeting title and select *Edit Series
       Template* item (see screen shot below)
    4. Change the template to the Blank/Quick Call template (this is needed
       because you're replacing the current templated with an edited one of the
       same name)
    5. Save the change of template
    6. Repeat steps 3-5, selecting the updated agenda template for the series)

An alternative to making two changes would be to copy the template to be updated
and give it a new name (e.g., "Working Meeting (April 2025)") so that it can be
chosen directly at step 4.

## Lucid Meetings Scheduling Process

  * Use the **+ Add Meeting** button at the top of the Lucid screen to start the
    scheduling process. Select OpenC2 TC and you'll be taken to the first page
    of the meeting scheduling process.

* The person who schedules a meeting in Lucid is automatically a
  facilitator, others need to have their role changed to
  facilitator.
  * TC co-chairs and the Secretary are facilitators for monthly
    TC meetings.
  * TC co-chairs, and the Secretary are facilitators for all
    working meetings. Work product editors will be specified as
    presenters for their work items in the working meeting
    agendas

* Uncheck the box in Lucid to receive emails for RSVPs if you
  don't want to get flooded.

* Only Facilitators and Participants can raise hands in Lucid, so
  set people's roles accordingly. Our convention has been:
  * TC meetings: TC co-chairs and Secretary are facilitators
  * Working meetings: TC co-chairs and Secretary are
    facilitators; work product editors are made presenters for
    their portions of the agenda so they can edit them.  
    * **NOTE:** Lucid only allows one presenter per agenda portion,
      so if there are multiple editors for a work product one
      should be identified as the presenter for any particular
      meeting.
  * Lucid Meetings roles are explained
    [here](http://support.lucidmeetings.com/support/solutions/articles/16000013446-roles-and-permissions-who-can-do-what-in-lucid)

* Need to use "Edit series attendees" in Lucid to change attendee
  information for an entire meeting series if you later want to
  add people or adjust roles
  * Click on the meeting in your Dashboard / Calendar
  * Click on the Attendees tab
  * Select "(Edit series attendees)" in the space above the table
    of attendees

![Edit Series Attendees](./images/Meetings-edit-series-attendees.png)


* The entire TC membership is invited to all TC and working
  meetings


## For efficient scheduling in Lucid:
1. Go into the OpenC2 "room"
1. Pick the agenda template for the meeting being scheduled;<br><br>
   **NOTE:** it's worthwhile reviewing and updating the agenda
   template before scheduling a block of meetings to make sure
   the content is current as of scheduling time, and to ensure
   all TC members in the "room" are added to the _template_ as
   attendees.<br><br>
1. Schedule the meeting (set date, time, repeats, end criteria
   for repeats; repeats should use the monthly / day of week
   setting)
1. Add people (sort the room members by role, add all Members /
   Observers; guests are only invited on a one-off basis)
1. Adjust roles for facilitators
1. Send invite email

We're a big "room" by Lucid standards, some actions take a little
time for processing. Some processing happens in the background
(e.g., invitation email generation and sending), but not all
(e.g., adding people to a meeting series). Occasionally you may
get a "504 Gateway Time-out" error on the latter; if that happens
backtrack to the meeting page
(`meet.lucidmeetings.com/meeting/xxxxxx`) to continue. Confirm
that the people have been added (they usually have). If you run
into issues, the Secretary has an account with the Lucid Meetings
support system, and has been very pleased with the quality of
their support.
